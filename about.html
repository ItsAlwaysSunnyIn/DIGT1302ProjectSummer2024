    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a small team of two aspiring software developers with a passion for travelling on a budget. We don't care where we go as long as the sun is out the temperature is hot and the price is right. This ethos inspired us to create this website. A free service that allows anyone on any budget to find their perfect vacation any time of year.</p>
    <p>Just use either one of our forms to search for your vaction. If you know your desired destination we can tell you the best time of year to go there. If you have your vacation dates, we can show you the best destinations for those dates.</p>
    <p>Whatever your budget, ideal temperature range, if you have a destination or time in mind or are flexible we can make sure that <em><strong>It's Always Sunny</strong></em>.</p>
